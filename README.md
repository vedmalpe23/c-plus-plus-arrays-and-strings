## Theoretical Background

### Arrays in C++

An array is a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type, stored sequentially in contiguous memory locations. Arrays are foundational data structures in C++ that allow constant-time access to elements via indices. Once declared, the size of an array cannot be changed, and memory is allocated statically unless managed through dynamic memory allocation mechanisms like pointers.

#### Characteristics of Arrays

* **Homogeneous Data Type:** All elements must be of the same type (e.g., `int`, `char`, `float`).
* **Fixed Size:** The number of elements is defined at compile time and cannot change during runtime (unless dynamically allocated).
* **Contiguous Memory:** All elements are stored in successive memory addresses, allowing efficient computation of an element’s location.
* **Indexed Access:** Elements are accessed using indices, starting from 0. This makes arrays ideal for iterative operations.
* **Efficient Access:** Accessing any element using its index is a constant-time operation (O(1)).

### Memory Layout of Arrays

In C++, arrays are stored in **contiguous memory blocks**, where the address of each element can be calculated based on the base address and the size of the data type.

For an array defined as:

```
int arr[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
```

Assuming the base address of `arr` is `1000` and the size of `int` is `4` bytes, the memory layout is as follows:

| Index | Value | Memory Address |
| ----- | ----- | -------------- |
| 0     | 1     | 1000           |
| 1     | 2     | 1004           |
| 2     | 3     | 1008           |
| 3     | 4     | 1012           |

Each successive element is placed at an address that is offset by the size of the data type (in this case, 4 bytes). The formula to calculate the address of the ith element is:

```
Address(arr[i]) = Base_Address + (i × Size_of_DataType)
```

This property enables highly efficient random access and is a major reason arrays are used in performance-critical applications like image processing, numerical computation, and systems programming.

### Types of Arrays

1. **One-Dimensional Arrays (1D):**
   Represent a linear structure. Common use cases include storing test scores, sensor data, and performing element-wise operations.

2. **Two-Dimensional Arrays (2D):**
   Represent a matrix-like structure with rows and columns. Suitable for tabular data, grids, image matrices, and mathematical computations involving matrices.

3. **Multidimensional Arrays:**
   Extend beyond two dimensions. These are used in complex simulations, multidimensional datasets, and nested structures. They require more memory and can be more complex to manage.

### Array Initialization and Access (Conceptually)

While initialization and access are typically done using syntax in C++, the conceptual understanding is:

* On declaration, the compiler allocates a contiguous block of memory.
* Each element in the array is accessed by computing its offset from the base address.
* Iteration is typically done using loops (for, while) with indexing.

### Advantages of Arrays

* **Predictable Memory Access:** The fixed layout allows the compiler and CPU to optimize access.
* **Simplicity:** Straightforward to declare and use in control structures.
* **Efficient for Fixed-Size Data:** Especially useful when the size is known at compile time.

### Limitations of Arrays

* **Fixed Size:** Cannot be resized dynamically (unless allocated on the heap).
* **Lack of Safety:** No bounds checking in C++, which can lead to undefined behavior if accessed out of range.
* **Limited Functionality:** Arrays lack the rich feature set provided by higher-level containers like `std::vector`.
* ## 1. Algorithm: Searching an element from the array

### Step 1:

Start the program.

### Step 2:

Declare an integer variable n to store the number of elements.

### Step 3:

Prompt the user to input the number of elements and read the value into n.

### Step 4:

Declare an integer array arr[n].

### Step 5:

Use a loop to input n elements into the array.

### Step 6:

Display the entered array elements using a loop.

### Step 7:

Ask the user to enter the element to be searched and store it in a variable called search.

### Step 8:

Initialize a boolean flag found = false.

### Step 9:

Use a for loop to iterate through the array:

- If arr[i] == search, display the index where it was found.

- Set found = true and break the loop.

### Step 10:

After the loop, if found == false, display "Element not found."

### Step 11:

End the program.

## 2. Algorithm: Reversing an given array

### Step 1:

Start

### Step 2: 

Read the size of the array n.

### Step 3: 

Create an array numbers of size n.

### Step 4: 

For i from 0 to n-1:

- Read the element numbers[i].

### Step 5: 

For j from n-1 down to 0:

- Print the element numbers[j].

### Step 6: 

End the program.

## 3. Algorithm: Concatenation of two strings

### Step 1:

Start

### Step 2:

Read string a.

### Step 3: 

Read string b.

### Step 4:

Concatenate string b to the end of string a.

### Step 5:

Print the concatenated string a + b.

### Step 6:

End the program.

## 4. Algorithm: Checking if the given string is palindrome or not

### Step 1:

Start

### Step 2:

Read the string a.

### Step 3:

Initialize a boolean variable isPalindrome to true.

### Step 4:

Calculate the length of the string, n = length of a.

### Step 5:

For i from 0 to n/2 - 1 (check till the middle of the string):

- If a[i] is not equal to a[n-1-i]:

- Set isPalindrome to false.

- Break out of the loop.

### Step 6:

If isPalindrome is true:

- Print "a is a Palindrome".

### Step 7:

Else:

- Print "a is not a Palindrome".

### Step 8:

End the program.
